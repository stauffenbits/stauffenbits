### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ttrpgift-app.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning authentication, it's a relearning, if you wanna do it right, but gets easier over time.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on graph visualizations.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with shining a ray of sunlight to illuminate the world with insight. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about optimizing software designs. I'll listen to you explain the problem you're trying to solve, and you'll realize what you're saying. But if I can look and interact with the source, I can shave some seconds off of that, (at times down to 0.05% of a working, first draft implementation).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [email](mailto:thwee.abacadabra.alchemist@gmail.com), my phone doesn't stay charged, because good news don't come from it, the interactions are meaningless, and someone neatly categorized them into "phone stuff" for me. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he, but what are you going to do differently, now that you know? 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I just discovered Banks.
